In this method, I have first extracted each drug discovery clinical study data of the Top 10 clinical studies with DMD diseease into a separate file and then have used the Python Dom Minidom Parser to extract required fields. Each cell in this notebook represents an individual clinical study. I have extracted all fields in the clinical study, so that I can get a eloborate look over the elemnts of the clinical study, which would help me in designing the Drug Discovery Study Ontology. "

      "What is the Study about: \n",
      "      Characterized by progressive disability leading to death, Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD)\n",
      "      remains one of the most common and devastating neuromuscular disorders of childhood.\n",
      "      Although a variety of promising new treatment strategies are in development, outcome\n",
      "      measures for clinical trials remain limited for the most part to a set of functional\n",
      "      measures, such as the six-minute walk test. While clearly useful, such measures are impacted\n",
      "      by unrelated factors, such as mood and effort, and have limited repeatability. To address\n",
      "      this and other limitations, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is now being investigated as a\n",
      "      surrogate measure. However, more easily applied, cost-effective, office-based surrogate\n",
      "      measures that provide high repeatability and sensitivity while still correlating strongly to\n",
      "      disease status would find wider use in Phase II and possibly in Phase III clinical trials in\n",
      "      DMD. Quantitative ultrasound (QUS) and electrical impedance myography (EIM) are two\n",
      "      techniques that could serve in this role. In QUS, muscle pathology (fibrosis and fatty\n",
      "      infiltration) in DMD results in an increase in energy reflected back (backscatter) to the\n",
      "      ultrasound. The amount of backscatter can be measured directly by analyzing the raw\n",
      "      frequency-based acoustic data or indirectly by controlled processing of the gray-scale\n",
      "      image. EIM, in contrast, relies upon the application of localized electrical current and\n",
      "      measurement of the resulting surface voltages, but is similarly impacted by the fibrotic\n",
      "      changes that develop as muscle disease progresses. Here, the investigators propose to\n",
      "      evaluate and compare both methodologies simultaneously in a group of DMD patients and normal\n",
      "      subjects in order to assess their ability to identify clinically meaningful alterations in\n",
      "      muscle health over short intervals of time. As a final exploratory analysis, the\n",
      "      investigators will also study the possibility of combining the two modalities. The results\n",
      "      of this work will have broad application as they could be applied to a variety of\n",
      "      neuromuscular conditions, including other muscular dystrophies. Thus, the hypothesis of this\n",
      "      proposal is that both QUS and EIM can serve as convenient, non-invasive, clinically\n",
      "      meaningful surrogate markers of disease progression in DMD that surpass the functional\n",
      "      measures currently in use.\n",

      "What is the Study about: \n",
      "      In DMD, muscle cells are damaged due to the absence of the dystrophin protein complex\n",
      "      necessary for normal muscle fiber function. Absence of dystrophin leads to muscle damage,\n",
      "      inflammation, fibrosis, and progressive dysfunction and weakness in the muscles of DMD\n",
      "      patients. The extent of diminished muscle function directly correlates with the extent of\n",
      "      intra-muscular fibrosis. The rationale for FG-3019 in DMD is based on data that show CTGF\n",
      "      reduces the ability of damaged muscle cells to repair themselves and promote muscle\n",
      "      fibrosis. In a preclinical study using an mdx mice model, FG-3019 reduced muscle fibrosis\n",
      "      and significantly improved muscle function. Each subject will receive FG-3019 (35 mg/kg)\n",
      "      every two weeks by intravenous infusion for two years. All subjects will be closely\n",
      "      monitored for safety. Efficacy assessments will be performed routinely over 2 years;\n",
      "      pulmonary and muscle function tests approximately every 3 months, MRIs once a year. This\n",
      "      study also includes a quality of life questionnaire.\n",

      "What is the Study about: \n",
      "      Boys with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) suffer from a relentless, progressive and fatal\n",
      "      disease due to lack of dystrophin, a critical muscle protein. There is currently no known\n",
      "      cure for the disease. GSK2402968 is thought to correct several genetic mutations through\n",
      "      skipping of exon 51 and therefore targets only those boys with these mutations.\n",
      "\n",
      "      A reasonable hypothesis is that increasing dystrophin will result in clinical improvement,\n",
      "      and that the amount of dystrophin expressed will correlate with clinical improvement above a\n",
      "      threshold level (e.g. around 30% of control). The initial limited efficacy data from\n",
      "      completed and ongoing unblinded studies with GSK2402968 are encouraging as they have\n",
      "      demonstrated de novo production of dystrophin and improved walking ability (primary efficacy\n",
      "      endpoint) after 48 weeks of treatment which has been generally well tolerated.\n",
      "\n",
      "      This study is designed to explore the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of two doses of\n",
      "      GSK2402968 given over 24 weeks. The two doses to be assessed are 6mg/kg/week and\n",
      "      3mg/kg/week. Based on pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic modeling, it is predicted at\n",
      "      steady-state that the 6 mg/kg/week dose will induce dystrophin expression greater than 30%\n",
      "      of control. The 3 mg/kg/week dose was chosen as modeling predicts 3 mg/kg/week of GSK2402968\n",
      "      will produce dystrophin expression in the range of 18-22%. Potential variability between\n",
      "      subjects could theoretically produce higher expression and lead to a dystrophin level\n",
      "      correlated with clinical improvement.\n",
      "\n",
      "      Following the treatment period, the study has a 24 week post-treatment phase. The purpose of\n",
      "      the post-treatment phase is to model the half-life of dystrophin, assess maintenance of\n",
      "      response, and provide information about resolution of adverse event and laboratory\n",
